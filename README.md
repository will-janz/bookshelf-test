# BookshelfTest

A rushed Angular application to showcase some of my skills. Requirements from [marrickmedical/angular-test](https://github.com/marrickmedical/angular-test).

## Goal
My goal with this is to show some experience and gain more. I want to learn, so please, **feel free to provide constructive criticism** in the form of an issue.

## Condensed ng docs
